### A. Descriptive Questions:
  ##### 1. Can we nest the Scaffold widget? Why or Why not?
    It is recommended not to use nested scaffold and the scaffold was designed to be the single top-level container for a MaterialApp and it's typically not necessary to nest scaffolds. we should be using one Scaffold per page / screen.
  ##### 2. What are the different ways we can create a custom widget ?
    By Right Clicking on Widget:
    By Right-Clicking on the Particular widget -> Refactor -> Extract Flutter Widget (we can also use shortcut Ctrl+Alt+W)
